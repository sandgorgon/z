# TODO
- remodel work to new(er) Scala version
	- might need to remodel the Actor franmework (or use Akka?)
- implement Dir [dir] already.
- restructure the editor in preparation for client-server architecture
	- IPC and plumbing

# Notes
Dir [dir]		Set the current or default directory that the z editor itself will assume

# Do we _want_ to do this, really?
- when colors are changed from the app/column tagline, they should stay active (?)
- a way to revert the colors back to the default (?)
