Command Set (B1 - mouse button 1 'left', B2 - mouse button 2 'middle', B3 - mouse button 3 'right')

	B2		Execute highlighted text or text under cursor as a system command
			This will open a +Results window  showing the results of running the command
			If a window had to be created,  the caret will stay in the current position it is at and results will be appended (see Scroll)
			From the +Results window, you can issue a Kill command to cancel the command
			If highlighted text is composed of multiple lines, each line is executed as a system command
	Shift+B3	Same as B2
	B2+drag	Highlight text and upon release of the drag perform B2 action on the highlighted text
	B3		Search for highlighted text under cursor or text under cursor (text can be a Java regular expression)
				Search wraps to the beginning of the file.
				If text is a valid file/directory, it opens the file/directory in a new window
	B3+drag	Highlight text and upon release of the drag perform B3 action on the highlighted text
	Ctrl + B1	Brace matching selection or generally symbol/char matching selection
				The following are matched: {}, <>, (), []
				Any other character/symbol when clicked will be used as the starting and
				ending symbols for a piece of text.

	B3 B3 B3	Triple click selects the whole line

	Get		Load the file/directory path specified in the front of the tag line
	Get [fname]	Load 'fname' but don't change the file path in the tag line
                        		Always relative to the current default directory of zuma
	Put		Save the file(if from windows tag line) - or files (if from the column/app tagline) - if dirty
	Put [fname]	Save the window content as 'fname'
                        		Always relative to the working directory of zuma

	New		Create a new window/column
	New [fname ...] For each 'fname' given, create a new window and load 'fname' (creates a new column when done from the app tag line)
	Zerox		Open a new window containing a copy of the current file in the window (window tag line only)
	Close		Close the window or the windows of a column/app if done from  the appropriate window/column/app tagline
	CloseCol	Close the column and all the windows in it, dirty windows are confirmed
	CLOSE	Same as Close, except for this time the dirtiness of the windows are ignored
	Lt		Move the window/column to the left
	Rt		Move the window/column to the right
	Dn		Move the window down in the column
	Up		Move the window up in the column

	Wrap		Toggles line wrap on or off.
	Indent		Toggles line indention on or off.
	Tab n		Set the tab space to be 'n'.
	Mark		Bookmark the current line location you are at.
	Clean		Toggles the file status to indicate that it is dirty(modified) or not
	Clear		Clear the content of the window(s)
	Cut		Cut the selected text in the window content and snarf it
	Paste		Paste the text in the snarf/copy buffer
	Snarf		Copy the selected text in the window content into the snarf/copy buffer - it is not called 'Copy' since we're keeping to its roots
	Undo		Undo the current editing changes
	Redo		Redo the changes that were undone
	Kill		Kill the command/process tied to the window 
	Scroll		Toggles scrolling behavior on or off.
				Used mostly when working with +Results windows.
				if on, scrolling will be the default scrolling behavior we expect
				if off, any updates to the text (say text appends) will not auto scroll the content and move the caret

	Sort		Sort the windows in a column lexicographically, if done from the app tag line, it will still sort the columns separately not all together.

	> cmd		Send the selected text in the window content as stdin for cmd
	< cmd		Send the stdout of cmd to replace the current text selection in the window content
			If no text is selected, then output is placed where the caret is
	| cmd		Send the selected text in the window content as stdin for cmd and replace the selection with the stdout of cmd
	! cmd		Run the command and replace the entire window content with its results (almost similar to '< cmd')
			From the app tagline, the command is executed and the results sent to a new window in the right most column. The column is created if no columns exist.
			From the column tagline, the command is executed and the results sent to a new window in the column.

	X 'regexp' cmd		Run the command on all windows whose path conforms to the single quote delimited Java regexp
	Y 'regexp' cmd		Run the command on all windows whose path does not conform to the single quote delimited Java regexp


	Font			Toggle the font being used (variable/fixed font)
	FONT			Toggle the font being used (variable/fixed font)
	Font 'name' [pt] 	Change the variable font being used to the font name given. You can optionally change the point size of the font as well.
				- you need the single quotes only if the font name has spaces
	FONT 'name' [pt]	Change the fixed font being used to the font name given. You can optionally change the point size of the font as well.
                                			- you need the single quotes only if the font name has spaces
	Fonts               	See the list of font names known by the application (app tag line only)

	Color(TBack|TFore|TCaret|TSelBack|TSelFore) intR intG intB
				Change the tag line colors - background|foreground|caret|selection background|selection foreground

	Color(Back|Fore|Caret|SelBack|SelFore) intR intG intB
				Change the body line colors - background|foreground|caret|selection background|selection foreground

	Dump [fname]		Dump the state of the column(s)
				From the app tag line, If no fname given, then it defaults to the filename 'zuma.dump' and will be saved in the current work directory
				From the column tag line, fname is required.
				
	Load [fname] [...]	Load a number of saved states in the order given


	Input [regexp]		Done from the tag line/content of a window where an external command is running.
				If no parameters, toggle the capability to send entered line text to the external command started, and use this regexp '.*[>$%#]' to define the prompt
				if regexp is provided, we will consider lines starting with the matched text as a valid prompt for the input line

	Bind			Do not create new windows, instead replace the current window's contents - if the Look action done by the user will create new windows.

	Any text not listed above is considered an external command to be executed when you B2 the text. 

Environment Variables

	The following are environment variables available to any external commands executed from zuma:

	Z_FP - the canonical path from the window's tag line
	Z_LOCAL_FP - the file path 'as is' from the window's tag line

Command Scope

	The scope of the commands change depending on what tag line you used to execute the command.

	In example, if you B2 a piece of text 'Put' in the column tag line, then that command will be executed across all windows of that column.
	Another example is, if you B2 a piece of text 'Clean' in the app tag line, then all columns and their windows will have their dirty status toggled.
	A further example, if you B2 a piece of text 'Put' in the window tag line, then that command will only apply for that window/file.
	If you are in the content pane of a window and you B2 a piece of text, the tag line it assumes is the window tag line.

Editing Keyboard Actions
	Ctrl + [Home|End]		Go to top/bottom of the file	
	Ctrl + [LeftArrow|Right Arrow]	Go to prev/next word
	Ctrl + [Backspace|Delete]	Delete word to the left/right of cursor
	Shirt + Cursor			Select from current caret position
	Shift + Ctrl + Cursor		Select from current caret position (word per word)
	Ctrl + A				Select All

	Ctrl+X		Cut
	Ctrl+C		Snarf
	Ctrl+V		Paste
	Ctrl+Z		Undo

	Home/End	Go to start/end of line
	Backspace	Delete character at current caret position
	Delete		Delete character to the left
	PageUp	Page up
	PageDn	Page down
	Ctrl + F	Complete the path just to the left of the cursor by opening a selection dialog box.
			In example, if you type in '/u/user/' (caret is just after the last slash '/') and you do the key combination, 
			then, a selection dialog box will appear and you can complete the path from there.

System Defaults
	Wrap		off
	Tab		4
	Indent		off
	Font 'Bitstream Vera Serif' 13    'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', and 'Bitstream Vera Serif' are also available by default from the application.

Special Conditions
	Filenames with a plus(+) sign prefix are never saved.  They are special filenames that are considered "scratch buffers" by the editor. An example of which is "/home/sandgorgon/+scratch". 
	But when you do a 'Dump' of the app, they will be preserved as part of the dump since you may want some of the scratch buffers next time you load the Dump file.
	Use them at will.
